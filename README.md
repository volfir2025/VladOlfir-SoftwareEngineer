# React + TypeScript + Vite

Developed by Microsoft, TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript. It adds type annotations, interfaces, and compile-time checking to JavaScript, helping to catch errors early on and improve code quality and maintainability.

React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Using TypeScript with React adds type safety to components, props, state, and hooks. This results in improved autocompletion and error detection for developers.

This app uses React's createContext() to manage global state, useState() and useEffect() hooks to manage and react to state changes, and React Router 6 to route between pages on the client side.

Key features include a dynamic resume page with section toggling, the ability to switch between light and dark themes, and the ability to download a resume as a PDF.

The project structure emphasizes modular, reusable components and strong type safety, ensuring a robust, maintainable codebase.
